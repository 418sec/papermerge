name: New Feature Pull Request

---

Please make sure you follow 3 important rules:

### Rule 1

PEP8.

All code must formated with [PEP8
style](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). If you code has couple of
minor deviations from PEP8 - that's ok. We are flexible here, but if your PR code formatting 
has serious violations of PEP8 - it will simply be rejected with comment *not PEP8 formatted*.


### Rule 2

Communicate. Document.

**Before creating pull request for a new feature** - please first discuss the
change you wish to make via GitHub issue, pull request or email. A
silent creation of PR for any sort of feature without any communication will
result in silent discard of your PR. If you are lazy to comment you your PR -
why should we care to communicate you the reason of rejection? :))


### Rule 3

Test. Test. Test.

Code without tests is broken design.
New features without basic tests will be rejected.
