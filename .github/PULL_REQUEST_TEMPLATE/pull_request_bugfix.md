name: Bug Fix (or minor code changes) Pull Request

---

Please make sure you follow 2 important rules:

### Rule 1

PEP8.

All code must formated with [PEP8
style](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). If you code has couple of
minor deviations from PEP8 - that's ok. We are flexible here, but if your PR code formatting 
has serious violations of PEP8 - it will simply be rejected with comment *not PEP8 formatted*.


### Rule 2

Test.

Code without tests is broken design.
Backup your bugfix with an unit test.

This rule is not very strict, depending on the context - adding a new unit
test might not be the case.
