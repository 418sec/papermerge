Backup/Restore
===============

For your peace of mind, Papermerge provides easy way to backup/export and restore all your documents.
Terms *backup* and *export* (similar for *restore*/*import*) are synonymous so I will use them interchangeably.
There are two different interfaces to backup and restore your documents:

    * User interface based (by clicking)
    * Command line based (suitable for automation)
