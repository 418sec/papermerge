Consumption
=============

Once youâ€™ve got Papermerge setup, you need to start feeding documents into it. Currently, there are four options: upload directly via web user interface, the importer directory, IMAP (email), and REST API.

Uploading document via web interface won't be explained here as it is very obvious. Uploading via REST API along with how to register a tocken is explaned in :ref:`REST API <rest_api>`. Here we will focus on importing from local directory and importing documents from email account (imap).
