Languages Support
===================

.. warning::

    Flexible language support is a new feature introduced in version 1.3.0 and
    it will be available starting with July 2020.


Papermerge uses `Tesseract <https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract>`_ to extract text from
scanned documents. 
Tesseract supports over 130 languages - thus with Papermerge you can have documents in any of those languages.
